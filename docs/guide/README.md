### [SQL querying with AWS Athena](guide/query.md)  
**Recommended for getting up and running quickly.** Run standard SQL queries at low-to-no cost.

### [Connect with Iceberg (SQL/DataFrame/ETL)](guide/iceberg.md)  
**Recommended for most workloads.** Use standard [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org) connectors to bring datasets into your own systems with pyspark, Databricks, Snowflake, and dozens of other integrations

### [ETL Raw Parquet](guide/raw.md)  
Don't like Iceberg or need something extra custom? The raw data parquet files are hosted in S3 for direct ETL into your system.
