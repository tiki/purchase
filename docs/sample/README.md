# Cleanroom Sample | Getting Started

TIKI's cleanrooms are hosted [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org) data lakes containing data legally licensed from users (zero-party), for your specific use case.

This sample cleanroom contains actual user demographic, transaction, and receipt data for the time period of 8/29 to 9/6.

**THIS DATASET IS FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT BE SHARED OR USED IN ANY OTHER FROM WITHOUT WRITTEN CONSENT FROM TIKI INC.**

## Access

Access to the cleanroom requires an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com). To request access, provide your TIKI representative with the **ARN for the IAM user or role.**

To find an IAM user's ARN open the [aws console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and head to IAM > Access Management > Users > {selected user}
