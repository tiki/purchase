# Purchase Data

TIKI data is legally licensed, explicitly from consumers, using rewarded programs across a multitude of verticals and applications. Data is pooled and aggregated against consumer identifiers to create a deep holistic dataset. 

**We handle the data sourcing, cleaning, matching, and legal terms enforcement, so you can focus on using data.**

Each record contains an associated audit trail and provenance, to automatically ensure data you source is legally usable for your specific use case. TIKI handles user and supplier compensation. You simply pay for what you use. 

Data is delivered in the form of hosted "cleanrooms", where a cleanroom is a subset of the larger dataset legally available for your use case, matching your filter criteria. For example, maybe you only want deidentified transaction data on people in Nashville from the last 90 days for analytic purposes. 

All data deliveries follow the [Apache Iceberg](https://apache.iceberg.org) open table format. Query directly, create a dataframe, train a model, plug into your ETL. Use Airflow, Databricks, Snowflake, or whatever tooling you love.
